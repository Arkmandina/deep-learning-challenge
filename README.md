# deep-learning-challenge

## preface

There were a couple of issues I ran into with the setup of these models. Since I was using google collab, I kept hitting caps that didn't let me fully run my code or the models. This also led me to not being able to save the models as HDF5 files though in the notebooks, you can see that the code is there for that to happen.

## analysis

This analysis is based on a hypothesis as I don't have that actual data. 
In the first model we trained the data to see what our accuracy score was going to be. The second model would come into play to try and make that accuracy score higher. Additional training perameters were used to increase accuracey. 

There are othe types of data modeling that can be used to check for accuracy as well as to test if are using the best possible outcome. Other models that can be run include a Logistic Regression Models as well as Neural Network Models but they have a tendency to overfit.

Overfitting occured several times while testing various features, and other additional layers, activation methods, etc.
With a Logistic Regression model, though similar to a Neural Network it can be used for binary classification and would be a good experiment to do. Though Neural Networks are typical, exploring other models and methods can make sure that you get the best and most accurate outcome for your data.
